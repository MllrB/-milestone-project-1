# OfficePrinters

Code Institute - Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Front End Development

This website is intended to generate sales leads for printers in the B2B environment. The concept is proven as there is already a live website that achieves leads, however, the live site has been performing poorly of late and I felt that this could be greatly improved with a more enticing look and feel and more focused design structure.

## UX

The primary goal of the site is for the customer to request a quotation.

### Design Considerations
The website is targeted towards a corporate audience with an emphasis on reducing the user’s workload. With this in mind, my goal was to design the site to be professional in look and have a clean, uncluttered and relaxing feel. To achieve this I chose soft colours and clear, easily legible fonts.

My intuition was that most business user’s would be researching new printers by browsing on a computer as opposed to a mobile device so I decided to separate the site’s features over 5 pages. Also, despite being the main focus for the site, I did not want to confront the user with a form to fill out on the landing page.  I wanted to point the user towards requesting a quote at every opportunity while still allowing the user to come to that decision at a time of their choosing.

I felt that a multi-page design was most suited to incorporating the following needs:

##### Needs of the Site Owner 
* Contact Form: A short form with the customers contact information and basic information on the customers requirements. This is the most important feature of the website and all pages have a link to it.
* A product page showcasing a few products the owner can provide and the brands the owner can source.
* Information about the company and links to the sister site.

##### Needs of the customer
* A means to obtain a quotation
* Easily accessible contact information
* Some information about the company
* Some information on the products the company provides


### User Stories

##### The Site owner 
* As the site owner, I want to advertise my business in order to attract new business customers
* As the site owner, I want to provide a way for new customers to contact me to initiate the purchase of a new printer
* As the site owner I want to direct all users, business or home users, to visit my existing ecommerce shop in order to purchase printer consumables

##### The Customer 
* As a customer, I want to get a quotation on a new printer for my office
* As a customer, I want to reduce the workload involved in researching and choosing a new printer
* As a customer, I want to find the right printer to meet my requirements with the minimum necessary cost of ownership

### Wireframes

##### Navigation
I had initially intended the following navigation structure, however, with the nav bar displayed on every page, there was no need to try to implement it as it is possible to navigate to all pages from any page.

## Features

### Existing Features
1. A landing page directing users to a contact form with a view to getting a quotation for a printer. The landing page also features a snapshot of the products page and a link to a sister site which offers printer consumables.

1. A short contact form allowing users to request a quotation by filling in some basic information about themselves and their requirements.

1. A product page showcasing a couple of the products on offer and the brands available to the company. Each product has a logo, an image, some quick benefits to the product and a link to more information. There is also a request a quote button which opens a modal asking for contact information. I intend for this to alert the site owner to the customers interest in a particular product although this feature is not functional at present.

1. An About Us page displaying some information about the company and a map showing where the company is situated 

1. A contact page showing users the address, telephone number, email address and opening hours for the company. All are clickable. The address links to a pin on google maps, the phone number initiates a call if applicable (on mobile), the email address will open a mail client.

### Features for the Future
1. Implentation of an plugin that will email the site owner with customer details and requirements when a quotation is requested
1. Modal thanking the customer for submitting their quotation request
